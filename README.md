# dump2sed

This code calculates a spectral energy density (SED) of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from a dump file of LAMMPS.
Because the code is written by C++, large systems can be analyzed.

# sed2tau

This code extracts linewidth of phonons from an SED.
The extraction is not fully automated.

## Prerequisite for sed2tau

* python>=3.0
* lmfit
